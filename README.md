There are multiple jupyter notebooks in this repository.

The order you should view them in is as follows:

1. preprocess_data.ipynb

2. pca.ipynb

3. knn.ipynb

4. svc.ipynb

5. cnn.ipynb

6. prcnn.ipynb

## Datasets:

I had to settle for a smaller dataset becasue my computer would crash when working with the FMA dataset. The GZTAN Genre Collection has 1000 songs. I was originally going to use 8000.

Originally I wanted to use the FMA dataset, but it was too much for my laptop at the time. Even the small dataset would crash when I would try and load all the melspectrograms.
